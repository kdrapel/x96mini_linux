# Installing Linux on X96 Mini
![x96](/x96-mini-smart-tv-box-android-71-s905w.jpg)

Goal is to install a Linux on a X96 Mini that I did not use anymore as a TV box and wanted to recycle as a DNS server for ads-blocking (https://pi-hole.net/) and other experiments. 

*Important: I will not give any support or answer questions related to issues happening with your own X96*

## Prerequisites
Instructions are covering steps on a Windows machine. Should be similar for Linux.
Based upon (messy) instructions found at https://forum.armbian.com/topic/12162-single-armbian-image-for-rk-aml-aw-aarch64-armv8/

### Hardware
* X96 Mini 2GB CPU is S905X. Label behind say "X96 mini RAM 2GB, ROM 16 GB".
* SD card, 16 GB. Smaller will be ok too (needs at least 8GB)
* Toothpick or small stick (reset button *inside* AV jack)

### Software
* Rufus 3.12
* 7Z

## Preparation
* Download Armbian_20.10_Arm-64_focal_current_5.9.0.img.xz (or more recent version). Link: https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=10763459528675575689
* Unzip this file to get Armbian_20.10_Arm-64_focal_current_5.9.0.img
* Launch Rufus, select the img. Click on 'Start'. SD card will be formatted and content will be written.

## Configuration of u-boot
* In Windows Explorer, navigate to your SD card. You should see a structure a 'extlinux' folder, 'dtb', etc. 
* Rename the file 'u-boot-s905x-s912' to 'u-boot.ext'
  
## Configuration of device tree block
* A Device Tree Block (DTB) is a file that contains important information about the target hardware (more info http://junyelee.blogspot.com/2015/07/a-tutorial-on-device-tree.html). So it is necessary to use the proper one. This is a tricky part and if an improper DTB is used, your target system will fail loading or the kernel will panic.
* Edit the file /extlinux/extlinux.conf
* Comment out all lines starting with FDT and APPEND (we don't want RK or AW configuration, we are only interested in AML s9xxx section). 
* Uncomment 'FDT /dtb/amlogic/meson-gxl-s905x-p212.dtb' and 'APPEND ....'. See example below

```
## Launching
* Unplug the X96 Mini
* Insert the SD card
* Using a toothpick, small stick or whatever suitable, press on the 'reset' switch which is located *inside* the AV jack. You don't need to press too hard.
* While the reset switch is maintained pressed, plug the power. The X96 Mini screen will appear and normally after a few seconds, it should switch to the Linux boot. 
* You can release the reset switch. Linux should run if everything is properly configured.
* I access it through SSH on port 22. It is of course recommended to change the default root password (root / 1234)

# Installing Pi-Hole on the X96

## Upgrading system
First upgrade your system. 

```bash
apt-get upgrade
```
About 50 packages or so are upgraded.

## Install Pi-Hole
It may fail by saying that your OS is not supported, just follow the instructions they provide in the error message in this case. I will not detail the complete installation, I used the default configuration step without doing any tweaking except giving the target IP address of my X96 on my network.
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | PIHOLE_SKIP_OS_CHECK=true sudo -E bash
```

## Configuration of router
* Assign a static IP to the MAC address of your X96. This must match what you defined in the PI-hole configuration.
* Switch the router to your new DNS server (as the primary). I left the secondary DNS server to my ISP default, just in case the X96 crashes or fails for whatever reason.

## Smoke testing
* Disable ad-blocking in your browser and navigate to some heavy websites

## Adding some lists
Additional lists may be useful for Youtube adblocking, here is my configuration.

## Other Softwares
* I managed to install Hyperion (ambient light/leds manager) as well and run it (the portal was working, I did not go further with the integration of actual lighting hardware). It was done through packages provided by apt-get. More info about Hyperion at https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng

## Wifi Setup
March 2023 - I managed to make the Wifi work as it was more convenient for me. Instructions are available here: https://forum.armbian.com/topic/20210-x96-mini-s905x-builtin-wifi-chipset-rtl8189es-working-with-recompilation/

This applies if your chipset is a RTL8189ES (Realtek). We will build the module ourselves, note that the compilation takes a rather long time (close to 10 minutes).

### Required files
* You need to download the file called ''linux-headers-current-arm-64_20.10_arm64.deb''. Link: https://github.com/armbian/upload/blob/apt.armbian.com/debs/linux-headers-current-arm-64_20.10_arm64.deb
* Make a clone of the following repository: git clone https://github.com/jwrdegoede/rtl8189ES_linux.git

```bash
dpkg -i linux-headers-current-arm-64_20.10_arm64.deb
```
### Compilation
* Navigate to the git repository of the driver.
```bash
cd rtl8189ES_linux/
make -j4 ARCH=arm64 KSRC=/usr/lib/modules/5.9.0-arm-64/build
sudo cp 8189es.ko /usr/lib/modules/5.9.0-arm-64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/
sudo depmod -a
sudo modprobe 8189es
```
* Check with dmesg if the driver is successfully loaded
* Check with iwconfig/ifconfig if your WLAN interface appears
* To connect to the access point: 
```bash
nmcli d wifi connect YOUR_ACCESS_POINT password YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Additional help regarding connection to access point itself: https://linuxhint.com/3-ways-to-connect-to-wifi-from-the-command-line-on-debian/

## Troubleshootings
* You can attach a keyboard and mouse to the USB ports. The Logitech receiver is also working such that I could use my keyboard.
